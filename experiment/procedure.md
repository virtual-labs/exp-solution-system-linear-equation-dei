1.	Enter co-efficients to choose a system of two linear equations in three unknowns and press “Submit” button to move further.
2.	Click on “System of linear equation under consideration” button to display the system of linear equations for which you just entered the values.
3.	Click on “Related matrices” button to understand the three matrices associated with the chosen system of linear equations.
4.	Click on “Consistency of chosen system of linear equations” button to determine and understand whether the given system is consistent or not.
5.	Click on “Click here” button or “Next page” button to go to the next page to understand the formula for consistency.
6.	On the next page you will find the section titled “Illustration to understand the formula for consistency” in the very beginning.
7.	The equivalent matrix equation and equivalent linear map equation are provided in this section. Notice that the co-efficients are based on previously submitted values on page one. That is, the linear map equation may change if the values chosen on page one are changed.
8.	The next section provides the visual explanation of the consistency of the linear map equation through diagram.
9.	Formula for consistency of system of linear equations is provided in the next section through the link between system of linear equations, matrix equation and linear map equation. This is the crux of the understanding of consistency of system of linear equations.
10.	Go through the remaining content on the page to complete the objective.
