1.	On the first page, go through “Given” and “To Discuss” information
2.	Click on “Existence” button to learn existence and “Uniqueness” button to learn uniqueness of solution of a linear map equation. It is explained through diagrams
3.	Click on the “Next” button to go to the next page which provides an opportunity for hands on experience to practice solution of a linear map equation.
4.	First go through the given linear map and its geometry. All the linear map equations on this page are related to this linear map.
5.	For Equation 1, click on “Consistent” button if you feel the equation is consistent otherwise click on “Inconsistent”.
6.	For all solutions in case of consistent linear map equation, enter the values of p and q and click on “check answer” button to check whether (p, q) is a solution. The reason is also provided.
7.	Repeat the same process for Equation 2.
8.	Click on the “Construction of More Equations” button to practice with new equations.
9.	Enter the values for r and s and click on “submit” button to get the new equation, its geometry and consistency.
