It is well known that various physical situations are modelled in terms of systems of linear equations. The aim of this experiment is to enable the user to appreciate the mathematics behind the consistency of such a system and to provide insight to the user to view the applications in the right perspective. This experiment is not focused on learning methods for finding solution(s) of a given system of linear equations. However, examples of common use displaying standard methods for finding solutions have been discussed.
