#### 1. System of linear equations:
Let us consider a system of two linear equations in three variables given below:<br>
ax<sub>1</sub>+bx<sub>2</sub>+cx<sub>3</sub>=r <br>
dx<sub>1</sub>+fx<sub>2</sub>+gx<sub>3</sub>=s       … (i) <br>
Note that in particular, if both r and s=0, then the system of linear equations (i) reduces to <br>
ax<sub>1</sub>+bx<sub>2</sub>+cx<sub>3</sub>=0 <br>
dx<sub>1</sub>+fx<sub>2</sub>+gx<sub>3</sub>=0       … (ii) <br>
This is called a homogenous system of two linear equations in three variables. <br>
#### 2. Coefficient matrix and augmented matrix: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\hspace{-9.2cm} \text{The matrix } A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\ d & e & f\end{pmatrix} \text{ and } B = \begin{pmatrix} r \\\ s \end {pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

are obtained from the coefficients of the equations given in the above section. The matrix A is called coefficient matrix and the matrix [A|B] is known as augmented matrix and is denoted by A+. <br>
#### 3. Related matrix equation:
Let A be a matrix of order m×n and B be a column matrix of order m×1. Then AX=B is called a matrix equation. The matrix equation related to the given system of linear equations in Section 1 can be written as AX=B, where 

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\hspace{-9.2cm} A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\ d & e & f\end{pmatrix} \text{ , } X = \begin{pmatrix} x1 \\\ x2 \\\ x3 \end {pmatrix}  \text{ and } B = \begin{pmatrix} r \\\ s \end {pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

Its solution provides a solution of the system of linear equations and vice-versa. It may be noted that system of linear equations is consistent if and only if related matrix equation is consistent.
#### 4. Example:
Consider 2x<sub>1</sub>+3x<sub>2</sub>+4x<sub>3</sub>=1 and x<sub>1</sub>-2x<sub>2</sub>+3x<sub>3</sub>=2 be a system of two linear equations in three variables. Then the coefficient matrix 

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\hspace{-9.2cm} A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\ d & e & f\end{pmatrix} 
\end{aligned}
$$

and the given system of linear equations can be written as AX=B, where 

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\hspace{-9.2cm} X = \begin{pmatrix} x1 \\\ x2 \\\ x3 \end {pmatrix}  \text{ and } B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\ 2 \end {pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

Clearly | is the augmented matrix. 
#### 5. Related linear map equation and its equivalence:
We discuss below the linear map equation associated with a matrix equation.
##### 5.1. Related linear map and its range: 
Let AX=B be a matrix equation. Recall from Experiment 5 that there is a linear map T:R<sup>3</sup>→R<sup>2</sup> associated with matrix A w.r.t. the standard basis of R<sup>3</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> . By definition, Range(T) ={T(x): x&isin;R<sup>3</sup>}. That is, y&isin;Range(T) if and only if there exist x&isin;R<sup>3</sup> such that T(x)=y. Note that Range(T) is generated by {T(e<sub>1</sub>), T(e<sub>2</sub>), T(e<sub>3</sub>)}.
##### 5.2 Linear map equation and its consistency:
The given system of linear equations represented by the matrix equation AX=B and leads to a linear map equation T(x)=b, where x=(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>)R<sup>3</sup> and b=(r, s)R<sup>2</sup>. It is consistent, that is it has a solution, that is there exist x&isin;R<sup>3</sup> such that T(x)=b, if b&isin;Range(T), as discussed in Experiment 7.
##### 5.3 Equivalence:
The matrix equation AX=B is consistent if and only if linear map equation T(x)=b is consistent. Furthermore if X is a solution of AX=B, then X<sup>T</sup> is a solution of T(x)=b and vice-versa.
#### 6. Solution of matrix equation:
##### 6.1. Consistency:
<b>Proposition: </b> (a.) Matrix equation AX=B is consistent if and only if RankA=RankA<sup>+</sup>. <br>
(b.) Matrix equation AX=B is always consistent if B=0, that is AX=0 is always consistent. <br>
<b>Proof: </b> (a.) Let AX=B is consistent. Then the matrix equation AX=B has a solution. Thus T(x)=b has a solution. Recall from Experiment 7 that T(x)=b has a solution implies that b&isin;Range(T). Recall from Experiment 5 that Range of T is generated by image of basis elements and image of each basis element leads to a column of A. Thus if b&isin;Range(T), then B is a linear combination of columns of A. This is equivalent to saying RankA=RankA<sup>+</sup>. <br>
Conversely, let RankA=RankA<sup>+</sup>. Then it means B is a linear combination of columns of A. <br>
As discussed in the preceding paragraph, Range(T) is generated by image of basis elements and image of each basis element leads to a column of A. Thus b&isin;Range(T) which means T(x)=b is consistent. This shows that the given matrix equation is consistent.<br>
(b.) As RankA=RankA<sup>+</sup> from the above proposition, the given homogenous system of linear equations is consistent.
##### 6.2. Uniqueness:
Let A be a square matrix and let the matrix equation AX=B be consistent. Then AX=B has a unique solution if and only if A is invertible. In this case the solution is X=A<sup>-1</sup>B. <br>
<b>Proof:</b> Recall from Experiment 7 that T(x)=b has a unique solution, where T(x)=b is the linear map equation associated to the matrix equation, has a unique solution (if it exists) if and only if T is one-to-one. Thus a consistent system of linear equations represented by AX=B has a unique solution if and only if A is invertible since A is a square matrix.
##### 6.3. Examples:
(i.) Consider the matrix equation AX=B, where 

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\hspace{-9.2cm} A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\ 2 & 6\end{pmatrix} \text{ and } B = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\ 1 \end {pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

<b>Consistency & uniqueness:</b>
Clearly 

$$
\begin{aligned}
A^+ = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & \vert & 4 \\
2 & 6 & \vert & 2
\end{pmatrix} 
\end{aligned}
$$


The rank of A is 2 and the rank of A<sup>+</sup> is also 2. Hence RankA=RankA<sup>+</sup>. Thus solution exists that is, the given matrix equation is consistent. As A is a square matrix and is invertible, by Section 6.2. (i), solution is unique. <br>
(ii.) Consider the matrix equation AX=B, where 

$$
\begin{aligned}
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 1 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix} 
\text{ and } 
B = \begin{pmatrix} 
2 \\ 
4 
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{aligned}
$$

<b>Consistency:</b>
Clearly 

$$
\begin{aligned}
A^+ = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 1 & -1 \vert & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \vert & 4
\end{pmatrix} 
\end{aligned}
$$

The rank of A is 1 and the rank of A<sup>+</sup> is also 2. Hence RankA≠RankA<sup>+</sup>. Thus the given matrix equation is inconsistent. <br>
(iii.) Consider the matrix equation AX=B, where

$$
\begin{aligned}
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 1 \\
1 & -1 \\
1 & 2
\end{pmatrix} 
\text{ and } 
B = \begin{pmatrix} 
2 \\ 
0 \\
3
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{aligned}
$$

<b>Consistency & uniqueness:</b>
Clearly

$$
\begin{aligned}
A^+ = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 1  \vert & 2  \\
1 & -1 \vert & 0 \\
1 & 2  \vert & 3
\end{pmatrix} 
\end{aligned}
$$

The rank of A is 2 and the rank of A<sup>+</sup> is also 2. Hence RankA=RankA<sup>+</sup>. Thus solution exists and the given matrix equation is consistent. As (1, 1) is the only solution which satisfy the above matrix equation, solution is not unique. <br>
(iv.) Consider the matrix equation AX=B, where

$$
\begin{aligned}
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 1 \\
2 & 2 \\
3 & 3
\end{pmatrix} 
\text{ and } 
B = \begin{pmatrix} 
2 \\ 
4 \\
6
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{aligned}
$$

<b>Consistency & uniqueness:</b>
Clearly 

$$
\begin{aligned}
A^+ = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 1  \vert & 2  \\
2 & 2 \vert & 4 \\
3 & 3  \vert & 6
\end{pmatrix} 
\end{aligned}
$$

The rank of A is 1 and the rank of A<sup>+</sup> is also 1. Hence RankA=RankA<sup>+</sup>. Thus solution exists and the given matrix equation is consistent. As (2, 0) and (0, 2) both satisfy the above matrix equation, solution is not unique. 
##### 6.4. Understanding the condition for consistency and uniqueness of matrix equation (through an example):
Example: Consider the matrix equation AX=B, where 

$$
\begin{aligned}
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix} 
\text{ and } 
B = \begin{pmatrix} 
4 \\
6
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{aligned}
$$

 Linear map:
We first find the linear transformation associated with A w.r.t. the standard basis B1={e1, e2, e3} and B2={f1, f2} of R3 and R2 respectively. Here e1=(1, 0, 0), e2=(0, 1, 0), e3=(0, 0,1), f1=(1, 0) and f2=(0, 1). Define T(1, 0, 0)=1(1, 0)+0(0, 1)=(1, 0), T(0, 1, 0)=-1(1, 0)+1(0, 1)=(-1, 1) and T(0, 0, 1)=0(1, 0)+1(0, 1)=(0, 1). If (x, y, z)=a(1, 0, 0)+b(0, 1, 0)+c(0, 0, 1); then a=x, b=y and c=z. Thus define T:R3→R2 by T(x, y, z)= aT(1, 0, 0)+bT(0, 1, 0)+cT(0, 0, 1)=a(1, 0)+b(-1, 1)+c(0, 1)=(a-b, b+c)=(x-y, y+z), where x, y, zR. Thus the linear transformation T:R3→R2 associated with the matrix A w.r.t. the basis B1 and B2 is T(x, y, z)=(x-y, y+z), where x, y, zR.
Linear map equation:
T(x, y, z)=b, where b=(4, 2)=BT is the linear map equation equivalent to the given matrix equation.
Consistency of linear map equation:
The linear map equation is T(x, y, z)=(4, 2) is consistent as b=(4, 2)Range(T).
Uniqueness of linear map equation:
Solution of linear map equation T(x, y, z)=(4, 2) is not unique as both (4, 0, 2) and (6, 2, 0) map to (4, 2). Notice that T is not one-to-one.
Understanding:
As b≡(4, 2)Range(T), (4, 2) which is the last column vector of A+ is a linear combination of column vectors of A. This implies that RankA=RankA+.
##### 6.5. Remark:
i.Let A be a square matrix and the matrix equation AX=B is consistent. Then it has a unique solution if and only if A is invertible.
ii.Let A be a matrix of order 2×3 and the matrix equation AX=B is consistent. Then it does not have a unique solution.
iii.Let A be a matrix of order 3×2 and the matrix equation AX=B is consistent. Then it may or may not have a unique solution. It has a unique solution if and only if RankA=2.
#### 7. Consistency (existence of solution) of a system of linear equations:
##### 7.1. Consistency:
Consider a system of two linear equations in three variables as given by equation (i). Then it is consistent if and only if related matrix equation AX=B is consistent if and only if RankA =RankA+.
In particular, a homogenous system of two linear equations in three variables as given in equation (ii) is consistent if and only if matrix equation AX=0, where 0= is consistent. In this case, clearly since A=A+, a homogenous system of two linear equations in three variables is always consistent. It is evident that (0, 0, 0) is a solution.
##### 7.2. Uniqueness:
Let solution of a system of two linear equations in three variables as given in equation (i) exists. Then it has a unique solution if and only if matrix equation AX=B has a unique solution.
##### 7.3. Example:
(i.) Consider the system of three linear equations in two variables given as follows 
x1+x2=2            ... (i),
2x1+2x2=4        …(ii) and 
3x1+3x2=6        …(iii)
Then the related matrix equation is AX=B, where A=, X= and B=. Its solution exists which is shown in the Example 6.4. (iv) above. Hence the given system of linear equations is consistent and the solution is not unique.
#### 8. Conclusion:
Following are equivalent: <br>
(a) System of linear equations is consistent. <br>
(b) Matrix equation is consistent. <br>
(c) Linear map equation is consistent. <br>
Therefore we study the consistency of a system of linear equations through the consistency of related matrix equation, i.e. which is consistent if and only if RankA=RankA<sup>+</sup>. The condition for consistency and uniqueness of matrix equation is understood through related linear map equation.
